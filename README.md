# Introduction
A Mealy sequence detector that detects 11010 on its serial input. the output becomes 1 when the desired input sequence is detected.
It was implemented using SystemC. a discrete test bench module has also been implemented for simulation purposes.
Finally signal traces have been added to a VCD file in order to display the circuit output.
waveform images and the state diagram corresponding to the designed sequence detector are provided.

# Dependencies
[SystemC 2.x](http://accellera.org/downloads/standards/systemc)

# Note
this code was developed in MS visual studio and the generated VCD file was viewd with [GTKWave](http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/).
